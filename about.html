    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>“When words become unclear, I shall focus with photographs. When images become inadequate, I shall be content with silence.”.</p>
    <p>“Photography for me is not looking, it’s feeling. If you can’t feel what you’re looking at, then you’re never going to get others to feel anything when they look at your pictures.”.</p>
    <p>“To me, photography is an art of observation. It’s about finding something interesting in an ordinary place… I’ve found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them.”</p>
